-- encrypt the connection that then use HTTP basic authentication to
-- validate requests. Keep in mind in these cases the secret is still
-- sent to the servers on the other side and passes in clear through
-- all layers after the SSL termination. Do /not/ use basic
-- authentication to protect secure or user-originated privacy-sensitve
-- information.

-- of time, then call this function; the body content will still be
-- streamed out by @io-streams@ in more-or-less constant space.
--

-- writes precisely that many bytes.

-- | Specify that this request should set the expectation that the

--
-- This function is special: in a PUT or POST request, @http-streams@
-- will wait for the server to reply with an HTTP/1.1 100 Continue
-- status before sending the entity body. This is handled internally;
-- you will get the real response (be it successful 2xx, client error,
-- 4xx, or server error 5xx) in 'receiveResponse'. In theory, it
-- should be 417 if the expectation failed.
--
-- Only bother with this if you know the service you're talking to
-- requires clients to send an @Expect: 100-continue@ header and will
-- handle it properly. Most servers don't do any precondition checking,
-- automatically send an intermediate 100 response, and then just read
-- the body regardless, making this a bit of a no-op in most cases.

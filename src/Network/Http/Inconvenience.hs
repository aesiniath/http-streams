    supported kludge. The justification for doing this is a) the functions
    accessing this IORef are themselves all in the IO monad, and b) these
    contortions are necessary to allow the library to be used for http:// URLs

-- certificates using the system certificates stored in @\/etc\/ssl\/certs@.
--
-- On other systems, /no certificate validation is performed/ by the
-- generated 'SSLContext' because there is no canonical place to find
-- the set of system certificates. When using this library on a

-- certificates somewhere and create your own 'SSLContext'.

{-
    We would like to turn certificate verification on for everyone, but

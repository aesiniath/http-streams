-- /Overview/
--
-- A simple HTTP client library, using the Snap Framework's @io-streams@
-- library to handle the streaming I\/O. The @http-streams@ API is designed
-- for ease of use when querying web services and dealing with the result.
--
-- Given:
--
-- > {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
-- >
-- > import System.IO.Streams (InputStream, OutputStream, stdout)
-- > import qualified System.IO.Streams as Streams
-- > import qualified Data.ByteString as S
--
-- and this library:
--
-- > import Network.Http.Client
--
-- the underlying API is straight-forward. In particular, constructing the
-- 'Request' to send is quick and to the point:
--
-- @
-- main :: IO ()
-- main = do
-- \    c <- 'openConnection' \"www.example.com\" 80
--
-- \     q <- 'buildRequest' $ do
--         'http' GET \"\/\"
--         'setAccept' \"text/html\"
--
-- \     'sendRequest' c q 'emptyBody'
--
-- \     `receiveResponse` c (\\p i -> do
--         xm <- Streams.read i
--         case xm of
--             Just x    -> S.putStr x
--             Nothing   -> \"\")
--
-- \     'closeConnection' c
-- @
--
-- which would print the first chunk of the response back from the
-- server. Obviously in real usage you'll do something more interesting
-- with the 'Response' in the handler function, and consume the entire
-- response body from the InputStream ByteString.
--
-- Because this is all happening in 'IO' (the defining feature of
-- @io-streams@!), you can ensure resource cleanup on normal or
-- abnormal termination by using @Control.Exception@'s standard
-- 'Control.Exception.bracket' function; see 'closeConnection' for an
-- example. For the common case we have a utility function which
-- wraps @bracket@ for you:
--
-- @
-- foo :: IO ByteString
-- foo = 'withConnection' ('openConnection' \"www.example.com\" 80) doStuff
--
-- \ doStuff :: Connection -> IO ByteString
-- @
--
-- There are also a set of convenience APIs that do just that, along with
-- the tedious bits like parsing URLs. For example, to do an HTTP GET and
-- stream the response body to stdout, you can simply do:
--
-- @
--     'get' \"http:\/\/www.example.com\/file.txt\" (\\p i -> Streams.connect i stdout)
-- @
--
-- which on the one hand is \"easy\" while on the other exposes the the
-- 'Response' and InputStream for you to read from. Of course, messing
-- around with URLs is all a bit inefficient, so if you already have e.g.
-- hostname and path, or if you need more control over the request being
-- created, then the underlying @http-streams@ API is simple enough to use
-- directly.

/Overview/

A simple HTTP client library, using the Snap Framework's @io-streams@
library to handle the streaming I\/O. The @http-streams@ API is designed
for ease of use when querying web services and dealing with the result.

Given:

> import qualified System.IO.Streams as Streams
> import qualified Data.ByteString as S

and this library:

> import Network.Http.Client

the underlying API is straight-forward. In particular, constructing the
'Request' to send is quick and to the point:

@
\ c <- 'openConnection' \"www.example.com\" 80

\ q <- 'buildRequest' c $ do
          'http' GET \"\/\"
          'setAccept' \"text/html\"

\ p <- 'sendRequest' c q 'emptyBody'

\ b <- `receiveResponse` c p

\ x <- Streams.read b
\ S.putStr $ fromMaybe \"\" x

\ 'closeConnection' c
@

Because this is all happening in 'IO' (the defining feature of
@io-streams@!), you can ensure resource cleanup on normal or
abnormal termination by using @Control.Exception@'s standard
'Control.Exception.bracket' function:

@
foo :: IO ByteString
foo = 'withConnection' ('openConnection' \"www.example.com\" 80) doStuff

doStuff :: Connection -> IO ByteString
@

for instance.

There are also a set of convenience APIs that do just that, along with
the tedious bits like parsing URLs. For example, to do an HTTP GET and
stream the response body to stdout, you can simply do:

@
\ 'get' \"http:\/\/www.example.com\/file.txt\" (\\p i -> Streams.connect i stdout)
@

which on the one hand is \"easy\" while on the other exposes the the
'Response' and 'InputStream' for you to read from. Of course, messing
around with URLs is all a bit inefficient, so if you already have e.g.
hostname and path, or if you need more control over the request being
created, then the underlying @http-streams@ API is simple enough to use
directly.

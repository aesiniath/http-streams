    The bit that builds up the actual string to be transmitted. This
    is on the critical path for every request, so we'll want to revisit
    this to improve performance.

    - Should we be using a Builder here? Almost certainly.
    - Should we just be writing to the OutputStream here?!?
    - Rewrite rule for Method?
    - How can serializing the Headers be made efficient?

    This code includes the RFC compliant CR-LF sequences as line
    terminators, which is why the Show instance above has to bother
    with removing them.

    This is a fair bit of trouble just to avoid using a typedef here.
    Probably worth it, though; every other HTTP client library out there
    exposes the gory details of the underlying map implementation, and
    to use it you need to figure out all kinds of crazy imports. Indeed,
    this code used here in the Show instance for debugging has been
    copied & pasted around various projects of mine since I started
    writing Haskell. It's quite tedious, and very arcane! So, wrap it
    up.
